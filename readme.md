## 2721415's Changes
I only worked with DOM this time and I didn't do the optional stuff.
- Imported some SAX exceptions
- Put tries and catches around the validation and print functions
- Wrote the function to print the menu using xpaths
Make sure you run it with two arguments: small_menu.xml small_menu.xsd
